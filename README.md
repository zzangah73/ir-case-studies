# ir-case-studies
This repository hosts two Propensity Score Matching (PSM) case studies developed for the institutional research workshop. The goal is to demonstrate the full workflow—from data preparation to matching, diagnostics, and interpretation—using reproducible Quarto documents.

No real student-level data are included.
All outputs are illustrative and show the analytic process, code, and structure only.

Rendered HTML files are provided for convenient review, while .qmd files in the docs/ folder contain the full source code.
