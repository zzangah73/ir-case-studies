# ir-case-studies
This repository hosts two Propensity Score Matching (PSM) case studies developed for an institutional research workshop. The goal is to demonstrate the full workflow—from data preparation to matching, diagnostics, and interpretation—using reproducible Quarto documents.

No real student-level data are included.
All outputs are illustrative and show the analytic process, code, and structure only.

The Quarto source files (.qmd) are stored in the repository root, and the rendered HTML files are located in the docs/ folder so they can be published via GitHub Pages.
